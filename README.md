# HotelBook_DigitalBhem
An essential task in the form of project which is a part of the Digital Bhem internship.

I had performed this project on the open source platform replit due to fast and furious running of the intellectual projects.

It is an project which taught us the fundamentals of HTML, CSS,javascript by not only learning things but also by implementing the concept to make realworld projects.

In this project HTML is building the structure by forms and a AC.jpg is the background image which is styled by CSS and all the types of functionality is performed by javascript.
